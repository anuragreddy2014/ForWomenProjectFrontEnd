                                Women goes out daily for performing various tasks. Some has to go for education, for work, for hanging out,
                                for household purpose, etc. Upon going out, Some questions will arise in their mind.Some of them are
                                <ul>
                                    The first thing which comes into their mind is that whether they are secured if they are going out alone?  
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    Will there be anyone who could harm them?
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    Should they ignore or surrender themselves to be the victim of harrasment?
                                </ul>
                               And much more questions are there which erupts into our mind when we have to go out.
                               </p>
                        <p  class="just"> Many women around the world face rape & sexual harrasments almost on daily basis.Many countries do not have 
                        proper systems of securing the women which results in lower number of women at work & lesser number of girls 
                        in educational institutions.But this is not the solution that we stop educating ourselves or stop working outside the world.
                        I think, self defence is the best solution which we must teach to every girl & women so that they could move in the society 
                        fearlessly & can protect themselves. So that they will not have any worry of going out of the house at any time of the day.
                         We need to empower today's women with all those techniques with which she can make sure about her freedom!

        Employability skills are necessary for obtaining, sustaining and progressing in a job. They include:

        Basic IT, literacy, and numeracy skills.
        Soft skills such as communication, team working, customer handling, problem solving, and planning and organising skills.
        Attributes/behaviours desired by employers such as initiative and flexibility.
        Changes in the structure of the UK economy and labour market over the past few decades have made employability skills even more important to have. 
        
        There are four main areas to develop employability skills.They are
        <ul>
            First, raising employability skills has emerged as an area for attention to improve the transition from full-time education into employment, including school leavers as well as those leaving college and university.
        </ul>
        <ul>

            Second, employability skills have been identified as a key element to ensuring that the employment and skills system is demand-led.
        </ul>
        <ul>

            Third, as part of the continuing integration of employment and skills policy there has been recognition that employers are looking for a broader set of generic employability skills and therefore to move unemployed people into sustainable work an approach that looks beyond vocational and technical skills alone is required.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Fourth, employability skills have arisen as a theme in debates about promoting career advancement once in employment and tackling the barriers to social mobility.

        Empowering women in the workplace, marketplace and community is a responsibility that falls on everyone’s shoulders.


We need to actively fight for women to be a contributing leaders in everyday life. Forget social norms, 
forget that women have been [and unfortunately still are] second class citizens, and remember that one woman at a time we are able to change the narrative.

Women don’t need to be “hostages” in this space, and cooking doesn’t need to be seen as a service provided to others.
The connection between cooking and social empowerment happens when women, regardless of their background, have a passion for cooking and are connected to 
an ecosystem that provides them with a space to express themselves by sharing their personal stories and talent.
the connection to economic empowerment happens as the women gain the know-how and access to resources necessary to turn their passion for cooking into viable revenue streams.

                   Women's participation in income generating activities is believed to increase their status and decision making. 
        Women empowerment is an important tool for bringing changes in their mental set up which ultimately leads to change in their living pattern.
         Therefore they need to be empowered through skill development programme. In this context College of Home Science provided skill training to rural women innovative embroidery. 
        There was a significant increase in the level of knowledge and skill performance of the respondents. Thirty two per cent of rural women started canning seasonally
         where as eight percent could get regular income.

        <p class="just">
        At least 1,000 women each month will learn to tailor and how to run a small tailoring business from their homes. Women enter the course not knowing the basics; they leave with a means to a livelihood and the capacity to provide for their own families sewing needs.
        
        Poverty remains widespread in India’s struggling economy with a hard hit. Widows and separated women are especially vulnerable to unemployment and poverty. In order to help widows and separated women along with other women Plan to Empower began tailoring classes to several slum and rural areas. These classes teach women to sew a wide variety of clothing from patterns which they can then sell.
        
        During the tailoring course, women learn to compute budgets for clothing and savings from making their own clothes. They learn to design and make a variety of clothes. Health, peace, and women’s rights lessons are also taught during class.
        
        Women learn to save money they would have spent on clothes in order to purchase a sewing machine and start a small business. Course graduates sew their family’s clothes, start a home-based
         business, and/or become sewing teachers.

                           Sport has huge potential to empower women and girls
                In many countries, it has been recognized that sport can be a force to amplify women's voices and tear down gender barriers and discrimination.  Women in sport defy the misperception that they are weak or incapable.  Every time they clear a hurdle or kick a ball, demonstrating not only physical strength, but also leadership and strategic thinking, they take a step towards gender equality.
                
                There is good evidence that participation in sports can help break-down gender stereotypes, improve girls’ and women’s self-esteem and contribute to the development of leadership skills.
                
                Second, women and girls continue to face discrimination in access to sports as athletes and spectators, and inequalities in professional sports, media coverage, sports media and sponsorships.
                
                Women are far more visible in sports today than at any previous point in history.  The Olympics of the modern era started as an all-male event, with women making gradual inroads to compete in different disciplines.  
                As such, women competed for the first time at the 1900 Games in Paris.  Of a total of 997 athletes, 22 women competed in five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism and golf.
                Incredibly enough, women were only allowed to run the marathon in the Olympics in 1988.  Also, with the addition of women’s boxing to the Olympic programme, the 2012 Games in London were
                the first in which women competed in all the sports featured.
                Sport is an area in which we can leverage our partnerships and engagement with different audiences to teach everyone that gender-based violence has no place in it, on or off the field, 
                anywhere in our lives and that a future where all playing fields are truly level for all women and girls can be achieved.

    <li>Many rural areas have a particular shortage
    of obstetric and gynecologic care providers.
    Nearly 6 million women live in counties
    without a single obstetrician-gynecologist.</li>
    <li>Ninety-seven percent of non-metropolitan
    counties have no abortion provider.
    Nonhospital abortion providers estimate that
    10 percent of their patients travel 50 to 100
    miles, and 8 percent more than 100 miles.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="just">
    Access to obstetric and gynecological care has been
    further restricted by closures of hospital-based obstetric services and the lack of sufficient
    incentives for health care providers to practice in rural areas. The American Congress of
    Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends encouraging health care providers “to utilize
    effective telemedicine technologies to expand and improve services for rural women.”
