           Equal employment opportunity is a government policy that requires that employers do not discriminate against employees and job applicants based upon certain characteristics, such as age, race, color, creed, sex, religion, and disability.
But now-a-days,men are having more employment opportunities than women.This is because women dont know much about the technology and the respective courses as well as the jobs that are present.
so,To empower women through employment,we provide the details of the job opportunities that are present in different sectors so that women who are interested in doing jobs can apply here.
we provide the jobs and their details in our website,so that women can choose the respective jobs ,they are interested in.And for those who are not aware of technology and dont know about technical courses,
we also conduct programs to bring awareness about technology as well as technical courses.

Not only on technical side,we provide the details of jobs that are present in different sectors such as salespersons,fashion designers,teachers etc..
The main aim of our website is to provide
employment opportunities for women who are interested in doing jobs either from home or from workplace.
