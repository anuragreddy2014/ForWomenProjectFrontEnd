            Telemedicine is the remote delivery of healthcare services, such as health assessments or 
consultations, over the telecommunications infrastructure. It allows healthcare providers to 
evaluate, diagnose and treat patients using common technology, such as video conferencing and smartphones,
 without the need for an in-person visit.</p>
<p>
Telemedicine has been shown to reduce the cost of healthcare and increase efficiency through better management of chronic 
diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or shorter hospital stays. ... 
Using telemedicine technologies reduces travel time and related stresses for the patient.
</p>

<p>
Rural women experience higher rates of
obesity, suicide, cervical cancer, and
limitations caused by chronic health
conditions than women living in urban areas.
Rural women are also less likely to receive
recommended preventive health services.
<ul>
<li>Many rural areas have a particular shortage
of obstetric and gynecologic care providers.
Nearly 6 million women live in counties
without a single obstetrician-gynecologist.</li>
<li>Ninety-seven percent of non-metropolitan
counties have no abortion provider.
Nonhospital abortion providers estimate that
10 percent of their patients travel 50 to 100
miles, and 8 percent more than 100 miles.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Access to obstetric and gynecological care has been
further restricted by closures of hospital-based obstetric services and the lack of sufficient
incentives for health care providers to practice in rural areas. The American Congress of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends encouraging health care providers “to utilize
effective telemedicine technologies to expand and improve services for rural women.”
