            Employability skills are necessary for obtaining, sustaining and progressing in a job. They include:

            Basic IT, literacy, and numeracy skills.
            Soft skills such as communication, team working, customer handling, problem solving, and planning and organising skills.
            Attributes/behaviours desired by employers such as initiative and flexibility.
            Changes in the structure of the UK economy and labour market over the past few decades have made employability skills even more important to have. 
            
            There are four main areas to develop employability skills.They are
            <ul>
                First, raising employability skills has emerged as an area for attention to improve the transition from full-time education into employment, including school leavers as well as those leaving college and university.
            </ul>
            <ul>

                Second, employability skills have been identified as a key element to ensuring that the employment and skills system is demand-led.
            </ul>
            <ul>

                Third, as part of the continuing integration of employment and skills policy there has been recognition that employers are looking for a broader set of generic employability skills and therefore to move unemployed people into sustainable work an approach that looks beyond vocational and technical skills alone is required.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Fourth, employability skills have arisen as a theme in debates about promoting career advancement once in employment and tackling the barriers to social mobility.
            </ul>
