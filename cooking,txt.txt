Empowering women in the workplace, marketplace and community is a responsibility that falls on everyone’s shoulders.


We need to actively fight for women to be a contributing leaders in everyday life. Forget social norms, 
forget that women have been [and unfortunately still are] second class citizens, and remember that one woman at a time we are able to change the narrative.

Women don’t need to be “hostages” in this space, and cooking doesn’t need to be seen as a service provided to others.
The connection between cooking and social empowerment happens when women, regardless of their background, have a passion for cooking and are connected to 
an ecosystem that provides them with a space to express themselves by sharing their personal stories and talent.
the connection to economic empowerment happens as the women gain the know-how and access to resources necessary to turn their passion for cooking into viable revenue streams.
