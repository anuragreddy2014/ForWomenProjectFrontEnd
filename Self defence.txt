Women goes out daily for performing various tasks. Some has to go for education, for work, for hanging out, for household purpose, etc. Upon going out, the first thing which comes into their mind is that whether they are secured if they are going out alone? Will there be anyone who could harm them? Should they ignore or surrender themselves to be the victim of harrasment? & much more questions are there which erupts into our mind when we have to go out. Many women around the world face rape & sexual harrasments almost on daily basis. Many countries do not have proper systems of securing the women which results in lower number of women at work & lesser number of girls in educational institutions. But this is not the solution that we stop educating ourselves or stop working outside the world. I think, self defence is the best solution which we must teach to every girl & women so that they could move in the society fearlessly & can protect themselves. So that they will not have any worry of going out of the house at any time of the day. We need to empower today's women with all those techniques with which she can make sure about her freedom!
