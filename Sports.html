           Sport has huge potential to empower women and girls
In many countries, it has been recognized that sport can be a force to amplify women's voices and tear down gender barriers and discrimination.  Women in sport defy the misperception that they are weak or incapable.  Every time they clear a hurdle or kick a ball, demonstrating not only physical strength, but also leadership and strategic thinking, they take a step towards gender equality.

There is good evidence that participation in sports can help break-down gender stereotypes, improve girls’ and women’s self-esteem and contribute to the development of leadership skills.

Second, women and girls continue to face discrimination in access to sports as athletes and spectators, and inequalities in professional sports, media coverage, sports media and sponsorships.

Women are far more visible in sports today than at any previous point in history.  The Olympics of the modern era started as an all-male event, with women making gradual inroads to compete in different disciplines.  
As such, women competed for the first time at the 1900 Games in Paris.  Of a total of 997 athletes, 22 women competed in five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism and golf.
Incredibly enough, women were only allowed to run the marathon in the Olympics in 1988.  Also, with the addition of women’s boxing to the Olympic programme, the 2012 Games in London were
the first in which women competed in all the sports featured.
Sport is an area in which we can leverage our partnerships and engagement with different audiences to teach everyone that gender-based violence has no place in it, on or off the field, 
anywhere in our lives and that a future where all playing fields are truly level for all women and girls can be achieved.
